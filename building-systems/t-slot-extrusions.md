# T-slot extrusions (8020) #
T-slot extrusions (also sometimes called 8020 extrusions, 
after a popular manufacturer, http://8020.net) are widely used in industrial construction. 
By using special nuts that fit into the slots on the sides of extrusions, connections 
can be made at any point along the length of the extrusion. Using various connection brackets and gussets, one can create complicated and sturdy constructions. In particular, most of 3d printer and CNC mill frames are constructed using t-slot extrusions.

These extrusions provide extremely sturdy and compact frame. However, the beams must be cut to size, using a miter saw, which makes these extrusions more difficult to work with than the construction sets such as Actobotics. Still, these extrusions are commonly used by more experienced FTC teams.
These extrusions come in several sizes; the one most suitable for FTC is 20mm and 1 in. 

T-slot extrusions are also used by a new robot building system, [REV Robotics](/r/FTC/wiki/building-systems/REV-Robotics), described in a separate section. 
They use 15mm square extrusions.

## Vendors ##
T-slot extrusions are offered by several manufacturers:

* [8020](http://8020.net) . Probably the best known manufacturer; large selection of parts. They call 20mm extrusions "20 series".

* [Misumi USA](https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/mech/M1500000000/M1501000000/).  Also a large selection, though not as large as 8020. Usually slightly cheaper than 8020. Misumi calls 20mm extrusions "5 series"

* [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/#t-slotted-framing/) catalog also sells t-slot extrusions. 
It is not known who is the manufacturer is, but it seems it is not one of the above. This is the easiest option, as ordering is easy and you can combine your order with other parts and tools you need to order on McMaster anyways. It is also the most expensive.

**Warning:** Note that extrusions from different manufacturers, even if they have the same outside dimensions, are not quite compatible. Most importantly, the width of the slot varies (6mm for Misumi, 5.26mm for 8020, 5 mm for McMaster-Carr).

If you do not know what to choose, go with Misumi.
