# Building Systems

For many teams who do not wish to fabricate their own parts, a variety of building systems is allowed.

## Tetrix

Due to its long support throughout FTC seasons, TETRIX is currently the most common building system present. Designed by Pitsco, its simple 32 mm aluminium channels are the backbone of the system, giving it enough flexibility and strength to be used in competition robotics. TETRIX mounting is generally easier to understand, and is still pushed by FIRST.

## Actobotics

Actobotics is a relatively new building system in FTC. It is designed by Robotzone. Unlike many other systems, Actobotics uses imperial measurements for their mounting system. Despite its use of the imperial system, it has earned the praise of being an extremley flexible and strong building system due to its strong aluminium channels and large selection of components, including their popular ServoBlocks.

Actobotics uses many more mounting holes per-face than other systems, giving it more mounting options.

## T-slot/8020 Extrusions
*Main page:* [T-slot extrusions](/r/FTC/wiki/building/building-systems/t-slot-extrusions)
T-slot extrusions (also sometimes called 8020 extrusions, 
after a popular manufacturer, http://8020.net) are widely used in industrial construction. 
By using special nuts that fit into the slots on the sides of extrusions, connections 
can be made at any point along the length of the extrusion. Using various connection brackets and gussets, 
one can create complicated and sturdy constructions. However, working with t-slot extrusions is more difficult than working 
with a construction system such as Tetrix or Actobotics.


## REV Robotics

## VEX EDR
*Main page:* [VEX EDR](/r/FTC/wiki/building/building-systems/VEX-EDR)

VEX EDR was only legal building system before FIRST Vex Challenge (FVC) was replaced by FTC. However, it is still allowed along with other systems. VEX EDR parts are made from cold-rolled steel and uses square holes and axles as a mounting system.

## VEX Pro
*Main page:* [VEX Pro](/r/FTC/wiki/building/building-systems/VEX-Pro)

VEX Pro is a system designed by FRC alumni to appeal to FRC teams. However, FTC teams may use the system to build as well. VEX Pro uses more conventional aluminium beams and hex axles.

## Raw materials

When the options above are not enough, you can always complement them by making your own parts out of raw materials
such as aluminum profile and plastic sheets.
