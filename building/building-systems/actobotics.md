# Actobotics
*go back to [/r/FTC wiki](/r/FTC/wiki)*

__This article is up to date as of Dec 6, 2017.__

Actobotics is a construction set distributed by ServoCity: http://servocity.com. 
It is similar to Tetrix, but the channels are slightly larger (cross-section of 1.5x1.5 in, or approximately 39x39 mm, 
as opposed to 32x32 mm for Tetrix), and the hole pattern is more complicated. 


Actobotics provides much wider choice of components than Tetrix, in particular 
offering stronger axles, ball bearings, servo mounts and more. 
ServoCity offers a 25% discount to all FTC teams, which is a great deal; in 
addition, they provide limited number of sponsorships to FTC teams every year.

The best way to get started with Actobotics is by getting their  
[FTC competition kit](https://www.servocity.com/ftc-competition-kit). 
As of December 2017, the price is $479.99 after FTC discount. The kit  comes with a choice of motors; 
most teams would need four NeveRest 40 motors.



## Channels and Beams 
Actobotics provides a number of structure elements; most commonly used ones are listed below. All of them are intended to be used 
with #6-32 screws (same size as used by Tetrix). 

* [__Channels__](https://www.servocity.com/structural-components/channel/standard-channel). These are main structure elements of Actobotics building system. These U-channels have 
1.5 x 1.5 inch crosssection and use Actobotics patented hole pattern. The pattern repeats every 0.75 in. 
The channels are available in different lengths, from 1.5 to 48 in. 

* [__Plates__](https://www.servocity.com/structural-components/pattern-plates). 
These flat plates use the the same pattern as Actobotics channels. 

* [__Mini-channels__](https://www.servocity.com/structural-components/channel/mini-channel). These mini-channels 
are much slimmer than regular channels  (0.585 x 0.37 in, or approximately 15 x 9.5 mm). Very useful for arms and other mechanisms. 

* [__Beams__](https://www.servocity.com/structural-components/beams/aluminum-beams). Rigid solid aluminum beams, 
with crosssection of 0.25x0.375 in. They fit inside the mini-channels. 

In addition, Actobotics offers a huge selection of various  brackets, connectors, spacers, and mounts. 


Actobotics hole pattern is not compatible with Tetrix, but there are 
[adapters](https://www.servocity.com/hub-adaptor-b) allowing one to connect Actobotics to Tetrix.

## Axles, hubs, bearings 
* __Axles__. Actobotics is most commonly used with [1/4in D profile axles](https://www.servocity.com/0-250-1-4-stainless-steel-d-shafting). Actobotics can also be used with  [D-profile 6mm axle](http://www.andymark.com/6mm-D-Shaft-p/am-6mmdshaft.htm) sold by AndyMark. 
* __Bearings__. Actobotics provides [ball bearings](https://www.servocity.com/motion-components/rotary-motion/bearings-bushings/ball-bearings), which are available  for 1/4 in and 6mm shafts. 
* __Hubs__.  For attaching wheels, gears, and sprockets to axles, you need hubs. It is highly recommended to use D-profile hubs, 
available in [set screw] (https://www.servocity.com/0-770-set-screw-d-hubs) (uses #10 set screw; tighten with 3/32 hex key) 
and [clamping](https://www.servocity.com/0-770-clamping-d-hubs) versions. The D-profile set screw hubs are far superior 
to the regular set screw hubs; clamping D-profile hubs are even better. The main drawback of clamping hubs is 
that they are not compatible with small (16 tooth) sprockets: the clamping part of the hub would hit the chain. 
To avoid this problem, use set screw hubs or put a hub spacer between the hub and sprocket. 

To connect Actobotics hubs to Tetrix components, use [Actobotics to Tetrix adapter](https://www.servocity.com/hub-adaptor-b). To connect Actobotics hubs to wheels and sprockets using AndyMark hole pattern, use AndyMark's [conversion plate](https://www.andymark.com/product-p/am-2609a.htm).

## Wheels
Actobotics provides [regular 4 in diameter wheels](https://www.servocity.com/4-heavy-duty-wheel) and  
[omni wheels](https://www.servocity.com/4-omni-wheel). Both are reliable and easy to attach. The regular 4 in wheels provide 
good traction on foam tiles, but if you need to climb ramps made of plastic or Euroboard (as it was in FTC 2015-16 RES-Q Mission), you might need grippier wheels such as AndyMark's [stealth wheels](http://www.andymark.com/Stealth-Wheels-p/am-stealthwheel.htm).

## ServoBlocks 
An extremely  popular item sold by Actobotics is their [ServoBlocks](https://www.servocity.com/servos/servoblocks). These assemblies act as an exoskeleton for servos, supporting lateral load on the servo spline. They are highly recommended in all situations where a servo is subjected to any side loads.
