# Actobotics #

Actobotics is a construction set distributed by ServoCity: http://servocity.com. 
It is similar to Tetrix, but the channels are slightly larger (cross-section of 1.5x1.5 in, or approximately 39x39 mm, 
as opposed to 32x32 mm for Tetrix), and the hole pattern is more complicated. 


Actobotics provides much wider choice of components than Tetrix, in particular 
offering stronger axles, ball bearings, servo mounts and more. 
ServoCity offers a 25% discount to all FTC teams, which is a great deal; in addition, they provide limited number of sponsorships to FTC teams every year. To find out more, visit  https://www.servocity.com/first


The best way to get started with Actobotics is by getting their  [FTC competition kit](https://www.servocity.com/ftc-competition-kit). As of December 2017, the price is $479.99 after FTC discount. The kit  comes with a choice of motors; most teams would need four NeveRest 40 motors.


Actobotics hole pattern is not compatible with Tetrix, but there are [adapters](https://www.servocity.com/hub-adaptor-b) allowing one to connect Actobotics to Tetrix.
