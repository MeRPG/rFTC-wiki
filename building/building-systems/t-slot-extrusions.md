T-slot extrusions (also sometimes called 8020 extrusions, 
after a popular manufacturer, http://8020.net) are widely used in industrial construction. 
By using special nuts that fit into the slots on the sides of extrusions, connections 
can be made at any point along the length of the extrusion. Using various connection brackets and gussets, 
one can create complicated and sturdy constructions. In particular, most of 3d printer and CNC mill 
frames are constructed using t-slot extrusions.

These extrusions provide extremely sturdy and compact frame. However, the beams must be cut to size, 
using a miter saw, which makes these extrusions more difficult to work with than the construction sets such 
as Actobotics. Still, these extrusions are commonly used by more experienced FTC teams.
These extrusions come in several sizes; the one most suitable for FTC are 15mm (which are not as widely available) 
and  20mm; some teams also use 1 in extrusions. 

T-slot extrusions are also used by a new robot building system, [REV Robotics](/r/FTC/wiki/building/building-systems/REV-Robotics), described in a separate section. 
They use 15mm square extrusions.

## Vendors 
T-slot extrusions are offered by several manufacturers:

* [8020](http://8020.net) . Probably the best known manufacturer; large selection of parts. They call 20mm extrusions "20 series".
* [Misumi USA](https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/mech/M1500000000/M1501000000/).  Also a large selection, though not as large as 8020. Usually slightly cheaper than 8020. Misumi calls 20mm extrusions "5 series". 
* [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/#t-slotted-framing/) catalog also sells t-slot extrusions. 
It is not known who the manufacturer is, but it seems it is not one of the above. This is the easiest option, as ordering 
is quick and you can combine your order with other parts and tools you need to order on McMaster anyways. It is also the most expensive.
* [REV Robotics](/r/FTC/wiki/building/building-systems/REV-Robotics)

**Warning:** Note that extrusions from different manufacturers, even if they have the same outside dimensions, are not quite compatible. Most importantly, the width of the slot varies (for 20 mm extrusions, slot width is 6mm for Misumi, 5.26mm for 8020, and 5 mm for McMaster-Carr).

If you do not know what to choose, go with REV Robotics or Misumi.

## Beams
All manufacturers sell the basic 20mm x20mm square beams, as well as double (20mm x 40mm) beams.

![Double extrusion](/r/FTC/wiki/building/building-systems/images/tslot-double.png)


Below is the comparison of prices for single 20 mm extrusion (as of December 2017)

* Misumi: $6.41 for 1 meter (part number KHFS5-2020-1000)
* 8020: $8.25 for 1 meter
* McMaster-Carr: $10.07 for 3 feet

Misumi and 8020 also offer custom lengths for small additional fee. If you don't have a miter saw, this greatly simplifies building.

## Fasteners 
To attach something to the t-slot extrusions, use t-slot nuts. There are several versions of these nuts.
### Pre-assembly end-feed nuts (also called slide-in nuts)
![Pre-assembly t-slot nuts](/r/FTC/wiki/building/building-systems/images/tnut-slidein.png)


These nuts have to be inserted from the end, which means that you need to think ahead and insert 
them at early stages of construction. They are also cheaper than other types of nuts.


### Post-assembly drop-in nuts
![Post-assembly drop-in nuts](/r/FTC/wiki/building/building-systems/images/tnut-dropin.png)

These nuts can be inserted in the middle of an extrusion, so they can be added at later stages of construction.

Neither Misumi nor 8020 offer drop-in nuts for 20mm extrusions, but you can get them  from 3rd party vendors on Amazon ([1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FOC6A8E/), [2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FOC6A8E/)). Note that you must pay close attention to slot width: nuts that work on Misumi (6mm slot width) will fail to work on McMaster-Carr (5mm slot width).

### Post-assembly roll-in nuts

![Post-assembly roll-in nuts](/r/FTC/wiki/building/building-systems/images/tnut-rollin.png)

These nuts can also be inserted in the middle of an extrusion; in addition, they have have a spring which keeps 
them in place even before the screw is tightened.


The nuts are rather expensive; for example, a 100-pack of Misumi roll-in nuts cost $43 
(part number [PACK-HNTP5-5](https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/detail/110302247640/)). 
Third party sellers on Amazon such as uxcell are cheaper, but the quality is not guaranteed.

### Screws
The nust listed above accept M5 (5mm diameter) screws, which can be bought from any manufacturer. Most people use button head M5 screw, which require 3mm hex key.

M5 screws are larger than \#6 screws used by Tetrix and Actobotics so they don't fit the holes of Tetrix/Actobotics pieces. The simplest (but destructive) way to deal with it is just by drilling out a hole to a larger diameter, using 7/32" drill bit.

**Warning:**	Note that the length of the screw must be "just right". If the screw is too long (for example, if you are trying to attach a very thin panel), then the screw will hit the bottom of the slot and will not be tight. In such cases, use a shorter screw or put a washer under the screw head. For most applications, you will need 8mm long screws; for thick plates and brackets, you might need 10 mm long screws.


## Brackets and gussets 
For connecting t-slot extrusions, one uses brackets and gussets, as shown below:

![T-slot brackets](/r/FTC/wiki/building/building-systems/images/tslot-brackets.png)


A variety of such brackets is available from all manufacturers. Fortunately, all brackets are compatible with extrusions from all manufacturers (as long as the brackets are for 20 mm extrusions and use M5 screws).
The brackets are also expensive, but you can save by buying cheaper brackets from third party vendors such as [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01A9JRZKE/) . In a pinch, you can also use [corner braces](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-2-in-Zinc-Plated-Flat-Corner-Brace-4-Pack-15294/202034104) from local hardware store.
