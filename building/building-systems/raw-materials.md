## Aluminum profile

Most common form of aluminum profile used in building is aluminum angle such as 3/4" × 1/16" 
aluminum angle available in HomeDepot and other hardware stores. It can be easily cut using 
hacksaw, Dremel, or miter saw. When strength is important, you can also use thicker (1/8") angle.
Other forms of aluminum profile commonly used are flat aluminum bars, U-channels and square 
aluminum tubing. If the selection in local hardware store is not enough, check out 
[McMaster-Carr](http://www.mcmaster.com/#aluminum/).

## Sheet metal
For buckets, ramps, and other flat structures, one can use sheet metal such as sheet aluminum 
available in local hardware stores. It can be easily cut using shears and bent using vise or 
special metal bending tool (see Tools page)
For rapid prototyping, perforated aluminum sheet such as [this one](http://www.homedepot.com/p/202525469) 
works great. It is very easy to cut and bend, but is not very strong.

## Plastic
Commonly used plastic includes clear polycarbonate plastic (better known under brand name Lexan), 
used for side panels and much more. Thin Lexan (up to 1/16) can be cut with shears; thicker plastic 
can be cut with jigsaw or mini circular saw such as Dremel SawMaxx. It can be bent using heat gun 
(see, e.g., this instruction video). Hardware stores commonly sell Lexan in 3/32 (0.093 in) 
thickness; McMaster-Carr carries a wide range of sizes.

Clear acrylic is cheaper than Lexan but much more fragile and is not recommended.

Another useful plastic is ABS (this is the material used for LEGO pieces). It is strong 
and easily machinable (can be drilled/cut with saw blade), and can be bent to desired 
form using a heat gun. Thin panels (1/16 inch) can be cut with snips; thick panels can 
be cut with jigsaw or Dremel.


## Rope/Cable

When you need to use rope/cable (e.g., for linear lifts), you can use 
Kevlar thread or braided fishing line. You can also get high-strength cord 
from [REV Robotics](http://www.revrobotics.com/REV-41-1162/), or [ServoCity](https://www.servocity.com/100lb-tensile-strength-green-synthetic-cable-5-meters)

## Surgical tubing
Surgical tubing is ferquently used either as a powerful spring, to assist motors, 
or for making sweepers. It is available in a variety of sizes, from 3/16" outer diameter to 1/2". 
 
For most purposes, 3/8" outer diameter, 1/4" inner diameter ([available on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GXXZGZ6) for $12.99 per 10 ft)
works well. ServoCity offers a thinner one (0.2"=5mm) [here](https://www.servocity.com/5mm-diameter-latex-surgical-tubing).
If you want stronger and less flexible one, you can get 1/2" OD, 1/16" ID [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PPMWLT6/).
